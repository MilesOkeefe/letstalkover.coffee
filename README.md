letstalkover.coffee
===================

A website to offer local people to come meet me over coffee.

I just moved to Berkeley and don't know many people. Took <a href="http://coffee.tgriff3.com/">Trey's idea</a> (with his permission) as a way to meet people.

When someone makes a request to get coffee it sends an email to me with the sender displayed in gmail as just a :coffee: emoji
